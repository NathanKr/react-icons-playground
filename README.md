<h2>Motivation</h2>
icons are popular , so you might use  <a href='https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css'>boostrap icons</a> which weight 118KB or  <a href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css'>fontawesome icons</a> which weight 30KB ,total is almost 150KB. This is the case even for one icon from bootstrap and one from font awesome. isnt there a better solution ?

<h2>Solution</h2>
react-icons provide you one stop shop for bootstrap , font awesome , ant , material design and many more icon families and all of this using one API and paying only for the icons you are using !

<h2>Setup</h2>
npm i 
npm run dev
